This repository's purpose is to showcase the smooth integration of Rally elements within a Next.js and React-based application, providing a clear example of how you can efficiently create a customized checkout experience for your customers.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Next, to launch the development server with https:

1. Add certificates folder in the root of the project
2. Generate the certificate inside the specified folder for localhost using the following command
  ```openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \
  -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")```
3. Double click on the created certificate `localhost.crt` inside finder to add it to your Keychain and change preferences for it to Always Trust
4. Run 
```bash
npm run https
# or
yarn https
